- Your server code does not compile because there is a discrepancy between the class name JDBCaccountDAO and
the class declaration: public class JdbcaccountDAO. (They should be the same).

- On TenmoController, on the addTransfer method the path should not have any id's on the path variable.
Anything that you want to pass in can be part of the body object. This id is however not being used anyways.
Same comment for the updateTransferStatus method.

- I am able to see myself on the list of users I can send money to, the account that is logged in should be
filtered out of the list.

- Upon successful transfer, consider displaying some sort of message.
